00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000

At this night
*You're welcome*

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000

As for me, my name is Hary Susilo Pratama
You can call me Hary, the nickname

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:37,140

Is a bit different, please don't mind it 
Just call me Hary
Continue Tik

9
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:40,090

My name is Atikah Khonsa

10
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:44,230

Yes
I think that's all from our team

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,240

Maybe there introduction from the others?

12
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:57,160

Okay, I am Hyudya 
Team lead also CEO of Tell

13
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:02,020

There Yudha Pratama our CFO

14
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:08,000

There also Natasha our junior developer 
And last there Tasha Cornelia

15
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,090

She is our team UI/UX 

16
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:13,220

Wow, so is this complete? 

17
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,220

Almost complete

18
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:22,070

Maybe that's all for the introduction

19
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,210

Maybe we can start the presentation now

20
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,100

Hary? You can start

21
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,170

Okay

22
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:30,220

Bismillah

23
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:33,170

May I share screen?

24
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,170

Wait

25
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,040

Done ry

26
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,110

Can you see it?

27
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,110

Yeah it's so dark

28
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,090

I can see it now

29
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,110

Bismillah

30
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,150

Okay, first of all

31
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,160

Before that, this is my design

32
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:04,150

Before that, this is based on our personal analysis

33
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:14,180

Maybe our analysis still have mistake and lack many things
We are still in our third semester and we are still newbie

34
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:24,050

So, we hope if there still many things that lacking or maybe wrong
We hope to get advice and critics from you

35
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:28,090

And in the end we want to ask for feedback to our design

36
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:34,030

First, we analysis the first page of Tell

37
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,100

Here, the home page right? 
We think

38
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,220

There should be some change

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,160

First, in notification

40
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:52,000

This notification is at right corner

41
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,140

Less visibble to user

42
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,200

Honestly, when I first use it
Like

43
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:01,000

Oh, there actually notification button

44
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:05,200

Also merges with the background

45
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:08,050

Because it's just outline

46
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:12,090

It's also separated with other button in navigation bottom bar

47
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:17,240

There also, home here

48
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:24,230

This is still confusing, because when we click 
it's just stay there

49
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,090

Like still, what is it?

50
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:33,060

Sorry harsh to say, but there no meaning

51
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:36,060

Right
Yes, useless

52
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,200

Then

53
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:42,200

There fun corner and stories, with a sentences 'Hi Tellizen'

54
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,140

We are confused
What is fun corner and stories about

55
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:51,210

We have to serach what the meaning

56
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:56,030

There no description what fun corner and stories is
and also

57
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,030

I think, there still

58
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,060

An empty space, so

59
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,150

To low, or maybe later

60
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:09,220

For the latest update, maybe there a new features

61
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,140

That's for home page, then

62
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,140

Second, here

63
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:24,030

Education is part of fun corner

64
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,150

Fun corner, education
Yes

65
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:32,060

We see there a plus button
To add post about 

66
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:42,230

Post anything we want confide about education there

67
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,040

That on right corner at the bottom

68
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,150

We think the placement isn't right

69
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:57,190

Because it's pile up with other features
such as like, reply, and 3 dots

70
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:03,230

Maybe, we can change it here

71
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:12,000

Maybe the one hours ago change to right or the others features
So, it didn't pile up like this

72
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:16,230

Or maybe the plus sign the one who change 

73
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,210

That the second one, and then

74
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:22,220

There more here, on fun corner
the 3 dots above

75
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:27,200

This is small and quite far above

76
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:35,060

It's also a bit confusing if we didn't know
it's less visible there

77
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,070

To see my post and my bookmark

78
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:40,140

It's to far

79
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:49,160

It's also make us confusing, what is that for
Oh, to see our post and bookmark at fun corner

80
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:53,170

Then, for stories

81
00:05:54,060 --> 00:06:00,100

In our design, that I make
We have some change

82
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,240

Like stories, my profile, and bookmark here

83
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:07,180

We put it in front, I will show it later

84
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:11,150

We also put search in front at home

85
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,080

Also

86
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,230

Continue, on setting

87
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:23,120

We think there some not suit

88
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,010

The placement of sign out button

89
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:28,150

If we put sign out up there

90
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:33,050

We afraid that later user

91
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:38,240

Will accidently touch the sign out button
because it's up there

92
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:43,200

Below fingerprint, if they have huge finger
There is a possibility

93
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:47,010

Usually, sign out put down below everything 

94
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:49,140

We also make some change there

95
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:53,010

There also in Tellizen community column

96
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,110

This Tellizen community

97
00:06:56,010 --> 00:07:01,000

I think for 'tell on twitter','tell on instagram','tell on medium', or
'tell on discord' like that

98
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,200

Is a repeated words, so

99
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:06,110

We also make some change there

100
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:10,090

Also we put user inteface on account

101
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:15,120

There account, notification, then user interface and later
sign out at the bottom

102
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,180

Like this

103
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,140

As for the design that I make

104
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:27,220

This is it
Before this, the first page

105
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,210

If we want to open 'Tell'
There a page

106
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:37,160

Diversion, before we got into 'Tell'

107
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:42,180

I forgot, at the sign up

108
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:54,230

'Tell' sign up button is still with white background 
plus just google icon and to small, it's unsuitable

109
00:07:55,050 --> 00:08:01,230

Here, we make it with a sentences "sign up with google" with google icon
and we make the color blue

110
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,120

Like this

111
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:07,190

Click this first, now we are login
This is the view of home page

112
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,100

Like I said before

113
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,040

I said before that my profile, bookmark, and other features

114
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:21,000

That still separate, now I made it into one

115
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:26,030

There home, the contents is fun corner and stories
I add some description

116
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:33,230

I add find to home from my stories

117
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:36,240

Notification from there to this

118
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,060

Chat features still the same

119
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:43,040

Profile from my stories I put it here and setting still the same

120
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:45,130

And then

121
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:49,060

Before we must went to category

122
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:55,150

We must went to the category, for example education

123
00:08:55,170 --> 00:09:02,090

Before, here the button is kinda pile up
I change and put it to the left

124
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,020

To add the post

125
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:13,030

I am not completely remodel design, I still retains the old design

126
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:19,130

Because I think 'Tell' have their own characteristic on their design

127
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:22,220

Like this part

128
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:32,080

What it's called?
The bar on the right
I think this is unique that why I still retains it

129
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:36,040

If you want to click like this

130
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:44,030

If you want post, but I also add

131
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:50,050

So that users are not complicated, that we must went to category
to add post

132
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:53,040

I add button create a post, so 

133
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,190

Just went to fun corner you can add post

134
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:59,220

But, here I add features category. Why?

135
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:03,090

So, when they typed

136
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,240

Add the category first

137
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:07,120

Before they post

138
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:11,060

Adding just like that

139
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,210

That's what we add on fun corner

140
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:25,070

Maybe a bit trivial, there is 5 categories. There one on the left
We make it to more right, so it's balanced

141
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:34,060

And also features search still the same
We make it like this

142
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:46,140

And for stories still the same, I just add a little here like before

143
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:49,200

On fun corner

144
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,010

So it can make stories there

145
00:10:55,180 --> 00:11:01,160

Next, notification
I make a little change

146
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,070

Notification like this

147
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,080

Like this

148
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:13,050

The features still the same, it can send private messages

149
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,010

Like this

150
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:23,110

And also I make some change

151
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:27,150

Before it's...
Stick

152
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:31,040

Yes, I make some change

153
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,020

I got inspiration from facebook and others application I use before

154
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:41,130

Okay
This is chatroom, I polish a little bit

155
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:42,240

Like this

156
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,200

The chatroom

157
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:52,000

Done with notification, also chatroom
On going, Pending

158
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:58,210

And profile, It still the same features 

159
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240

But for draft and bookmark I put it above there

160
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:09,190

This is for post or stories the user made before

161
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,210

So it will saved there

162
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:19,130

Before, for fun corner have to be in fun corner
There my post and my bookmark so it's separated

163
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:36,240

Also in stories there also my stories and my bookmark for stories
But we make into one, so everything on profile

164
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:46,190

Like this, stories like this
This, I didn't make it. If the bookmark empty
Also the same with draft

165
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:52,060

My post still the same, the difference is just the background

166
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:57,050

Users past post, like this

167
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,120

Then now to setting

168
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:05,080

We make it simple, like this

169
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:14,180

Here, that was user interface there dark mode and text size
We make into one here

170
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:18,010

Fingerprint, all of them become one
And what we said before

171
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:24,160

Tellizen community, it's better to just put the community name

172
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,020

The platform like twitter, instagram, medium, and discord

173
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,140

And the sign out at last 

174
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:36,050

At the bottom, not make users confused

175
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,000

There also dark mode features

176
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,190

Like this

177
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:46,090

Same with contact us via email, term condition, privacy policy, and attribution
I make it a bit light

178
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:48,220

It's not quite visible on light mode

179
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:58,210

On my personal opinion, there not many people who want to know about that

180
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000

Okay, if we sign out
We go back to the first page, like this

181
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,240

Okay that's all

182
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:10,040

Our analysis

183
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:16,140

Maybe back to MC?

184
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,030

To Nia

185
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:25,120

Maybe that's all for our team design presentation

186
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:30,220

Maybe we may know how the feedback is?

187
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000

From our design
How the feedback

188
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:38,030

Okay, guys I am gonna give the feedback first

189
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:43,100

Overall I appreaciate, this is great honestly I appreaciate it

190
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:55,200

This is cool from 3rd semester student, I already saw some of the design
Just from that is already enough, not enough but just right
Know how to place it, even from the UI and UX

191
00:14:55,220 --> 00:15:01,090

But I don't want to say much from UI/UX
Later for Miss Cornel to said it 

192
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:08,090

First, I want to tell you about the first button here
The sign in

193
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,120

From a technical point of view

194
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:20,050

We use library from google, so for customized is takes a lot times

195
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,200

So, sometimes there developer who just went 'just like that'

196
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,090

And customize from google is hard

197
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:36,040

That the feedback I can give to you guys, so you guys know
There some developer not that they don't want to, but because it's hard 
to customized

198
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,190

And then

199
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:48,210

The last one in the setting

200
00:15:51,170 --> 00:16:01,000

I actually disagree when you said, people didn't care about contact us via email
The truth is we are

201
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:07,140

I meant we are community base, so user will try reach us to developer directly

202
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:13,010

Even via instagram, twitter, or discord. Because

203
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:16,150

Some want to contact via email, why to email

204
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:23,170

Because, first by email is the privacy and really two-way direction
And really know who it is in social media

205
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,040

They talk more, usually there complaint about banned

206
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:38,080

(Example)
And that was quite long, not something to do at twitter or instagram
that why it's should went to email 

207
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:46,020

And whe you said it's not concern, that actually a concern for
privacy policy and term condition

208
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:51,200

Why like that? because if we talk about community base
Tell is anonymous right?

209
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:55,120

Because of that, there some users

210
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,090

Insecure, was the developer

211
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:03,160

Get any my information, but what?
That why we make it visible, so

212
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:14,150

So if they want to se our privacy policy about what we do with the information
You can see it, it meant as written, and visible also get clicked

213
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:19,070

That's why we make it bold so it can be seen
same with term and condition, because

214
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,160

There still many thing that get questioned in the community

215
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:35,190

What I can and can't do here, that's why there is term and condition
like I can't curse here or say anything sexual

216
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:44,200

We make it visible, so there no one who gonna say that I didn't see it

217
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:52,050

So, we close the chance for users to say 
that they didn't see or don't know about it

218
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,180

That's from the community side

219
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,230

Honestly we, from me personally I appreciate it so much because

220
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:00,210

Why?

221
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:07,130

So, honestly why we harshly speaking have a messy design
And I admit it, it's very messy

222
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:10,140

Because we are still test

223
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:14,000

What we test is not the UI but the function

224
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:16,000

Tell founded in 2018

225
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:21,080

We tried if Tell like this what gonna happen

226
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:26,160

The released new version with UI like this what gonna happen

227
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,240

Change again to version 3, the one you guys use

228
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,070

And that's why we are doing this questioner in this month is for

229
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:39,230

The version 4 will be better on UI/UX and neat

230
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,120

That's all from my view

231
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:50,030

Actually I want to talk about button, but I will let Mr. Yudha or
Miss Cornel about that
I think that's all

232
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:53,110

Thank you

233
00:18:53,140 --> 00:19:03,040

If you see, from UI/UX side
There is color contrast

234
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,060

Have you heard it before?

235
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,240

As for me not yet

236
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:11,010

So, color contrast is

237
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:23,190

About how sentences and background can't be unseen

238
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,170

So it should nice to look at

239
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,220

Okay next

240
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,090
I want to ask, why the google icon is on the right not the left

241
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:45,110

It's from how we pronounce, so sign up with and there the google icon

242
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:55,120

Okay, but it would be better if there an icon like that
Icon on the left and sign up with google still written 

243
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:58,040

Still write the google?
Yes

244
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:01,010

Okay next, anything else?

245
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:07,030

Visual hierarchy, have you heard visual hierarchy before?

246
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:16,090

Visual hierarchy, it's like position? Where the eye is first fixed on

247
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,220

Yes

248
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:23,050

You want to highlight fun corner and stories

249
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:28,020

It's better if the color isn't the same with the detail/description

250
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:32,070

The difference can't small, the font size

251
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:39,120

Size in button small normal large

252
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,180

This 
Yes

253
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:53,010

There also a minimal for the height, that is 32

254
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:54,220

Okay

255
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,210

Okay, as from me
Overall good from the design

256
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:04,240

Quite fresh for us

257
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:14,020

There many inspiration we got for reference

258
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:17,190

Some feedback from me is

259
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:23,190

The placement for the button

260
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:33,080

We make it the design like that, there is some consideration in it
First for example


261
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:39,100

This plus button, to add post

262
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:44,120

We put it on the right, just because it's easy to reach
With thumb

263
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,090

I think on setting

264
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:57,040

My feedback is same with the others, actually this is good
The account become one

265
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:07,060

The config above and Tellizen is a good input, we can consider it

266
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:11,180

I think that's all from me, what else?

267
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:16,050

Thank you 
You're welcome

268
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,060

Maybe that's all?

269
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:20,060

That's all from us
Anything else?

270
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,230

Maybe more?

271
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:28,100

Overall, there not really. Honestly from me we appreciate it 
This is cool, we have

272
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:32,190

We need input because we are going for Tell 4v 
There so much more

273
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:36,200

Thing we need to fix, also reference from you guys is also a happy thing

274
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:39,220

Done?
Yes it's

275
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:44,070

Thank you so much to Tell Developer team

276
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:46,200

To make time for us

277
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:56,140

We are sorry, because our design is still far from perfect

278
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:59,140

Still need to get fixed

279
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:05,100

It's okay everyone start from zero, we are all still learning

280
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:17,000

We also happy, also appreciate to meet Tell Developer team, to have the chance
to redesign and get the feedback from the developer directly

281
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,000

That's right

282
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,050

That's right ry

283
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:30,070

Thank you for Tell Developer team to give feedback to our design

284
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:36,230

We are sorry if our design analysis is still deviated

285
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:40,010

Thank you, Should I close it?

286
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:43,110

Yes
It's okay

287
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,240

Okay, Assalamu'alaikum
Good Night

288
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:48,030

Wa'alaikumsalam
