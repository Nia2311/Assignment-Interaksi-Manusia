00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,000
Hary:
Hallo?

1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,190
Hary:
Is it in?

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:04,010
Nia:
Yes, it is

3
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:05,190
Hary:
The voice? Okay

4
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,010
Hary:
Shall we start?

5
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:09,110
Hary:
Assalamu'alaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh

6
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:12,160
Nia & Atikah:
Wa'alaikumsalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,100
Hary:
Alhamdulillah

8
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:20,040
Hary:
Right now, we can meet here and we already decided before

9
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:28,010
Hary:
What application we use to review the UI and UX, 
that we will make for the improvisation

10
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:30,170
Hary:
There is application called “Tell”

11
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:35,010
Hary:
It's like, you guys already knew

12
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:40,160
Hary:
This application is kind of like any other social media.
Kinda like Wattpad, mixed with Facebook

13
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,170
Hary:
So it can send comment and make stories

14
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:47,200
Hary:
There something special about it, that the sender is anonymous

15
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:53,220
Hary:
You guys already try it before right? 
And we already agreed to search 

16
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:57,200
Hary:
The thing we must improve form this app 
either from the UI or UX

17
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,210
Hary:
So from that, what do you think Atikah?

18
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,220
Atikah:
For login page

19
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,220
Atikah:
Google icon is to small 

20
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:12,170
Atikah:
And the table for tick isn’t easy to see 
So 

21
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:15,090
Atikah:
The user might get confused

22
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,010
Atikah:
User don’t know

23
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:24,130
Atikah:
if they should click the tick 
or google icon first

24
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:28,050
Atikah:
Then, google icon better placed in the center

25
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:37,000
Atikah:
Because, if it's placed at the bottom it isn’t easy to see.
There is also, setting page

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,080
Atikah:
This, there is

27
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,230
Atikah:
There is sign out button

28
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:49,110
Atikah:
It’s better to place it at the bottom

29
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,090
Hary:
Why though?

30
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,140 
Atikah:
Attribution, after attribution

31
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:57,160
Hary:
Yes, why?
Atikah:
If it’s placed there

32
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:07,070
Atikah:
User might accidentally press the sign out button

33
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:10,050
Hary:
That right, they put it above and bellow fingerprint

34
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,210
Atikah:
Yes, it should be at the bottom

35
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:14,200
Atikah:
Let it be sequential
Nia:
it's weird

36
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,170
Hary:
Yes, that right
Nia:
Yes, also

37
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:24,040
Nia:
If you pay attention, it's like the layout get cut off
it's long right? but it's like get cut off and there is fingerprint

38
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,230
Nia:
at the middle

39
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:28,130
Hary:
Yes, it's a bit confusing
Nia: 
The placement

40
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,220
Atikah: 
Yes it's confusing
Hary:
And then, what else Tik?

41
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:44,220
Atikah:
And then, there is Tellizen Community
There tell on twitter, tell on instagram,
tell on medium, tell on discord, it should be

42
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,010
Atikah:
It better if didn't  write tell on there
so that

43
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,160
Atikah:
So that, there no waste of words

44
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,050
Hary:
Yes, so there no repeated words
Nia:
Yes, that's right

45
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,160
Atikah:
Yes ry
Nia:
Isn't it the same?

46
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:01,130
Nia:
There words 'tell on' but there also icon
isn't it just the same?

47
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:05,220
Atikah:
Yes, it's better just the icon
Hary:
Yes, that's right

48
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,190
Hary:
Just the icon
People even know that icon twitter

49
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:10,020
Nia:
Yes

50
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,070
Nia:
Just the icon
so it will be short

51
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,150
Atikah:
Yes, there no need for the words

52
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:17,000
Nia:
It's wasting and

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24.000
Nia:
To covering the emptiness
I don't know, it better not be

54
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25,000
Hary:
Anything else, Tik?

55
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:27,150
Nia:
Come on, Tik

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,180
Atikah:
Also, column user interface exchange with 
tellizen communtiy

57
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:39,120
Hary:
Why exchange?
Atikah:
So user easy to find it

58
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,090
Atikah:
What?

59
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,110
Hary:
Exchange? Why?

60
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:45,100
Atikah:
It's easier for user

61
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:50,140
Atikah:
if they want dark mode or not
so they don't have to scroll down

62
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:53,110
Hary:
Yes, so like sequentially right?

63
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:56,010
Nia:
Yes
Atikah:
so it's sequentially and neat

64
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:01,130
Nia:
But that's right
usually if you see other application

65
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:08,120
Nia:
Like, if you want to send to other app
they usually put it at the bottom

66
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,020
Nia:
Usually

67
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,150
Atikah:
Yes, usually like that

68
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:17,110
Hary:
Usually like that, right?
Something like community or another social media

69
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:21,140
Hary:
at the bottom
also user interface at the bottom
like

70
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:24,130
Hary:
How?
Just weird isn't?

71
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:30,220
Nia:
This is just, a bit confusing
why they put it like that
I didn't understand

72
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,030
Nia:
I really didn't understand
Hary:
Anything else Tik?

73
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,080
Nia:
Anything else?
Atikah:
I think enough

74
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,240
Nia:
Enough?
Atikah:
Enough

75
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,180
Hary:
Oke, thank you Tik

76
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,170
Hary:
Atikah done, now
Atikah:
You're welcome

77
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:44,130
Hary:
So, Nia
How it is, Nia?

78
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:48,130
Nia:
As for me
it is in Home page

79
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:49,210
Nia:
Home page
Hary:
Oke home page

80
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:50,210
Atikah:
Yes, home page

81
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:51,180
Nia:
So in the home page

82
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,030
Nia:
It is quite a lot

83
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:58,000
Nia:
First, the button

84
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,200
Nia:
There home button, I already tried it

85
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,160
Hary:
Where?

86
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,040
Nia:
There home
Hary:
Where the button?

87
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,160
Nia:
Can you point it out?
Hary:
The one shape like house?

88
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,070
Atikah:
This one Ni?
Nia:
The one shape like a house, yes

89
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:11,160
Nia:
That one, this is a home page
why is there a home button

90
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:16,200
Nia:
There no, what it's called?
there no function
that's what I meant

91
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:21,020
Nia:
Why put home button at home page
that the first one

92
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,070
Hary:
Now that you mention it
Nia:
Right?

93
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,150
Nia:
That's weird right?
Atikah:
That's right

94
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:25,230
Nia:
Home page

95
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:30,070
Nia:
But there a home button
home button like that usually at

96
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:33,220
Nia:
Like in fun corner, if you want back to home
there home button right?

97
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,170
Nia:
But there isn't, what I meant is

98
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,100
Nia:
Why put it at home page?
When that actually home, right?

99
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:44,060
Nia:
Then, on 'Hi Tellizen' sentences

100
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,110
Nia:
Also the card of fun corner and stories

101
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,150
Nia:
I think it's a little down

102
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,140
Nia:
That's
Atikah:
That's right

103
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,070
Nia:
Above it

104
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,210
Nia:
Kinda empty

105
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:54,210
Atikah:
Like just empty?

106
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,220
Nia:
The way they put it

107
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,100
Nia:
How do I say it, like

108
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,150
Nia:
What is it again?

109
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:05,180
Nia:
Kinda, not good to look at
after all it's just empty
but

110
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,010
Hary:
Too much space right?

111
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:10,110
Nia:
The space is unreasonable

112
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:13,140
Nia:
Also the picture they use as wallpaper page (background)

113
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,150
Nia:
The 2 persons in the picture
isn't it a bit too long?

114
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,200
Nia:
Look at below 

115
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:25,160
Nia:
Either it's just adjusting to the picture size
I don't know

116
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:29,000
Nia:
And then, for the notification button

117
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:32,010
Nia:
The placement is a bit

118
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:35,190
Nia:
On the right corner
I think it isn't suit 

119
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:40,090
Nia:
So usually notification is

120
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:45,240
Nia:
Even though, there is some who put it there
but not just notification

121
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,190
Nia:
But there also more
Hary:
So there another one like that?

122
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,160
Atikah:
Yes, there another one

123
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,100
Nia:
But this is just notification

124
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,030
Hary:
It's separated

125
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:56,070
Nia:
It's a bit kinda
It's separated with the one below
why not just put it together

126
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,100
Nia:
You know like

127
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,090
Nia:
Can I say the brand?

128
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,190
Hary & Atikah:
It's okay
Nia:
Say the brand?

129
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,150
Nia:
Like shopee

130
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:05,050
Nia:
For shopee, notification and others is the same on the bottom

131
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:11,050
Nia:
It's just like, nice to have all application or features
all of it at the bottom so

132
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:14,190
Nia:
It's nice so we can just search it at one place

133
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:16,140
Atikah:
Yes, It's easier

134
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,130
Nia:
It's made more easier to search

135
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:23,240
Nia:
And also the icon is just a line
that's meant

136
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,120
Nia:
It's hard to see with background like this

137
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,230
Nia:
Isn't?
Hary & Atikah:
Yes, it's hard to see it

138
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,200
Nia:
Before that, you can't see it right?
Hary:
I can't see it

139
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,210
Nia:
You can't see it right?

140
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:36,180
Nia:
Before, I got a notification from my phone

141
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:40,000
Nia:
I also open, what the name?

142
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,220
Nia:
I also open the application
That when I see the notifaction, you know from the phone
the slide one

143
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:50,230
Nia:
There is notification, but
from the app I can't see it

144
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,090
Nia:
I got confused

145
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:54,210
Nia:
The notification icon isn't visible, yes
Hary:
It's just line after all?

146
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:59,070
Nia:
Yes, it's just line
and I can't see it with the background like that
so like that

147
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:02,020
Nia:
So isn't right, I think it's better to place it at the bottom

148
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:07,110
Nia:
Together with another features
like for chatting and setting

149
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:09,200
Nia: 
And then

150
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,190
Hary:
What else Ni?

151
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,190
Atikah:
What else Ni?

152
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:19,130
Nia:
I think that's all...
Oh, and the color choice isn't that good

153
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,010
Hary:
Which color?

154
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:24,120
Nia:
In general?

155
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,040
Nia:
It's kinda a bit
The color choice is

156
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,240
Nia:
Like

157
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:34,100
Nia:
It's nice to see it
but isn't it just white?

158
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,200
Nia:
Just white, I meant the background is just white
Hary:
Lack variation?

159
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,010
Atikah: 
Yes
Nia:
Just white, the background is just white
but

160
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:44,070
Nia:
Kinda like not really

161
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:47,050
Hary:
Like monotone?
Nia:
Yes, monotone and

162
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:51,130
Nia:
The function? 
like there is person chat just that right?
It's like

163
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:58,090
Nia:
What is this?
What that person doing?
What kind of application is this?
Actually it's kind of confusing

164
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:01,000
Nia:
What to do?
Atikah:
Oh, it's lack directions?

165
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:06,070
Nia:
It lack directions, that's for sure
just from the looks

166
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:11,070
Nia:
Also adding from before, there a lot of space
that's meant

167
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:14,150
Nia:
Lack adding information and others

168
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:17,010
Nia:
For the application
Hary:
If we want a lot

169
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:22,080
Hary:
if they want to empty it
It should be added by something

170
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,240
Nia:
Yes, added something

172
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,170
Atikah:
Yes

173
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:26,240
Hary:
It wouldn't be that empty

174
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,240
Nia:
Yes, like that
Hary:
Actually

175
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,090
Hary:
Anything else Ni?

176
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:32,060
Nia:
Maybe, that's all

177
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,210
Nia:
Maybe I will add it later

178
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,210
Hary:
Now, from me
Nia:
Maybe, Hary

179
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:47,000
Hary:
If it's from me, this is from stories and fun corner
Now, we go to stories first

180
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,050
Hary:
This is, added a bit from what Nia said

181
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:53,040
Hary:
Connected with home page

182
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,080
Hary:
This is, if we see it

183
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:03,240
Hary:
At the bottom navigation bar
there is stories, my profile, and bookmark
right?

184
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,200
Hary:
It's different with
Atikah:
Yes

185
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:10,030
Hary:
Bottom bar navigation, bottom navigation bar

186
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:12,150
Hary:
At home, get back to home
Nia:
The one before right?

187
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:15,140
Hary:
It's kind of different

188
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:20,050
Hary:
If we click stories, and in to
get in to the stories Tik

189
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,200
Atikah:
This one right?

190
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,040
Hary:
Yes, it's look kinda different

191
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:30,220
Hary:
Now, try to the fun corner page Tik

192
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,120
Atikah:
This?
Hary:
No, no, fun corner more

193
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,130
Hary:
The one
this one, this is fun corner

194
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:39,000
Hary:
It's look like, there no bottom navigation bar 

195
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:51,020
Hary:
So there features fun corner and stories
it's should be the same, there should be both
a bottom navigation bar, but there none

196
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:56,050
Hary:
And there 3 dots above
inside it is my post and bookmark

197
00:10:56,050 --> 00:11:00,240
Hary:
Different from stories, where the my post and bookmark
placed at the bottom

198
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,160
Hary:
In bottom navigation bar, so

199
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,190
Atikah:
Yes, there it is

200
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:07,070
Hary:
Like this, yes
it's kinda like

201
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:11,000
Hary:
What is it? Kinda unstable
features one and another

202
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,120
Hary:
I suggest
Nia:
It's not consistent

203
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,100
Hary:
For the home page, yes
for the home page, let's back to home page

204
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:23,170
Hary:
For the home page, it's better we didn't use this
we use the home page

205
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:32,030
Hary:
The one in stories, but the home page button
is for universal. For all features, wherever we want
it still there

206
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:35,030
Hary:
The bottom navigation bar, same like Facebook

207
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:37,080
Hary:
In facebook there one at above all, always there

208
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,070
Atikah:
Yes
Hary:
But this one is at the bottom

209
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:41,050
Nia:
Yes there is
Hary:
So if we want 

210
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:45,010
Hary:
We want to click any features
it always there, we back again

211
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:47,180
Hary:
To the 3 features

212
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:50,190
Hary:
There also features home
Nia: 
Yes

213
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:53,140
Hary:
The home one, Nia said it can't right?
Nia:
Yes it can't

214
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:56,150
Hary:
It can't get clicked?
Nia:
Yes it can't, it's confusing

215
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:04,150
Hary:
It's would be better if we make the home as 
it should be

216
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:15,190
Hary:
So, in home there like this
fun corner and stories, later beside it
if we click anything it would change to
can we see the stories one Tik?

217
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:18,040
Nia:
This one?
Atikah:
This

218
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:31,080
Hary:
So, for this navigation the one in the stories
we made as navigation for home page, the main one
so, the stories one we change it to be the home page
there my profile and stories, we change it to home page

219
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:38,150
Hary:
Inside home page is the features to stories and fun corner

220
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:45,100
Hary:
In fun corner, there 3 dots above
it's not easy to see it

221
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,210
Nia:
Yes
Hary:
The purpose 

222
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:48,110
Atikah:
This one
Hary:
The purpose is for

223
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,040
Hary:
That one, the one above

224
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,110
Hary:
if we click we can see bookmark

225
00:12:53,110 --> 00:13:03,120
Hary:
We can see bookmark from fun corner and post that we post 
from fun corner, it's the same features with the one in stories 

226
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,07
Hary:
So, it's better if we at the my profile
let's go to my profile

227
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,210
Atikah:
This?

228
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:14,030
Nia:
Just now
Hary:
Before that

229
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:16,180
Atikah:
This?
Hary:
No

230
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:19:05
Nia: 
My profile Tik

231
00:13:19:05 --> 00:13:25:15
Hary:
In this my profile, there will be your stories and your post

232
00:13:25:15 --> 00:13:28,100
Hary:
Post meant that our profile is fun corner

233
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,230
Hary:
So in my profile there is all features, the 2 features

234
00:13:31,230 -->  00:13:37,220
Hary:
It's also the same for bookmark,
bookmark from stories and fun corner

235
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:42,000
Hary:
And there also, as you can see there 'Hi Tellizen'

236
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,120
Hary:
There stories and editor pick
that also I don't understand, what the purpose is 

237
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,170
Hary: 
It can't get clicked

238
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:50,230
Atikah:
Yes, it can't get clicked
Nia:
it's the same

239
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:56,200
Nia:
Same, I can't understand if it can't get clicked
Hary:
Yes, I can't understand what the purpose

240
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:03,150
Hary:
I think that's all
Oh and in the fun corner Tik

241
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:06,010
Atikah:
This
Hary:
In this fun corner

242
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:08,170
Hary:
There 5 elements? 5 category right?

243
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:10,070
Hary:
There lounge
Atikah & Nia:
Yes

244
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:15,130
Hary:
There education, beauty, games, and arts
This is as you can see the position

245
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:17,240
Hary:
Arts not in the center

246
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,180
Hary:
It's unbalanced
Nia:
Yes

247
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,230
Atikah:
Yes
Hary:
So

248
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:28,140
Hary:
A bit left, so the fun corner is a bit to center

249
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:34,220
Hary:
Also, at the post of fun corner

251
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,210
Hary:
This one

252
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:42,230
Hary:

Hary:
For reply, features for like, and 3 dots for other features

255
00:14:54,140 --> 00:15:00,200
Hary:
And below there a plus to adding a post
it's kinda crash (pile up)

256
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,070
Atikah:
Crash with other icons?

257
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,240
Hary:
Yes, crash with other icons

258
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,050
Hary:
Kinda pile up

259
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:12,000
Atikah:
That's right
Hary:
It's better to put it

260
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:14,160
Atikah:
The right side?
Hary:
So, maybe

261
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,000
Hary:
Yes, the right side
Atikah:
Right

262
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,210
Hary:
Right? Maybe left?
Nia:
Right?

263
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,040
Atikah:
That's right, the left side
Hary:
That right side

264
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,170
Nia:
Actually it can be both

265
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:28,060
Nia:
It can be both betwen reply and post
that meant

266
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:31,100
Nia: 
3 dots on the left or otherwise
Hary:
That's right

267
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,080
Nia:
As long they're not the same
Hary:
One of them must change

268
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:38,050
Nia:
Yes
Hary:
One must change, so there no pile up

269
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:46,010
Hary:
Then, back to stories

270
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:47,190
Hary:
Stories

271
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:52,180
Nia:

Hary:
No, that the my profile

Nia:
Oh the stories, the one with the stories post
Hary:

Hary:
This is it, in stories there are category

274
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:04,090
Hary: 
In the category, there an icon

275
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:10,020
Hary:
There is icon love life, school life, college life, work life,
and many more. There an icon, but it look like inconsistent

276
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:13,080
Hary:
Look at love life, college life, and work life

277
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:18,040
Hary:
Their icon just a line art, just a white line

278
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,030
Hary:

00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:24,220
Hary:
They use vector so it's not consistent

280
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:30,060
Hary:
It would be better if use line art then all of them is line art,
all vector then all of them is vector

281
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,220
Hary:
It's not consistent

282
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,200
Nia:
And there a question mark

283
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,090
Atikah:
Yes, that question mark
Nia:
The question mark, I don't understand

284
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:44,110
Hary:
Yes that, childhood memories with question mark
what? Why not just a picture of child

285
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,080
Nia:
That's right

286
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,020
Atikah:
It's cute
Hary:
It's about childhood right?

287
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:50,000
Hary:
If it's riddle question mark, it's clear

288
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,190
Nia:
Yes, maybe just that
Hary: 
I think that all
Atikah:
Done?

289
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,100
Hary:
What else? Anyone want to add more?

290
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,120
Hary:
It's already quite a lot

291
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,220
Hary:

Nia:
Quite a lot

292
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,230
Nia:

293
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,220
Hary:

Nia:

294
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,210
Nia:
Maybe, we see it one more time?

295
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:11,230
Atikah: 
How about my bookmark?

296
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,140
Hary:
Oh, right there also features

297
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:17,210
Hary:
Dark mode right?
Nia:
Yes, dark mode
This is the dark mode

298
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:27,210
Hary:
It's quite nice, maybe there some people who had
problem with their eyes. As we can see the background
is all white

299
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:31,170
Hary:
So, with dark mode features

this dark mode

302
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:43,050
Hary:

309
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:12,020
